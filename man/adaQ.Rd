\title{models the forward selection of the kernels for the adpative variant}
\usage{
adaQ(K, select, n)
}
\arguments{
\item{K}{list kernel similarity matrices}

\item{select}{integer vector containing the order of selection of the kernels 
in \code{K}. Typically, the \code{selection} field of the output of 
\code{\link{FOHSIC}}.}

\item{n}{number of selected kernels. Typically, the \code{n} field of the 
output of \code{\link{adaFOHSIC}}.}
}
\value{
list of matrices modeling the quadratic constraints of the
adaptive selection event
}
\description{
Similarly to the fixed variant, the adaptive selection of the 
kernels in a forward fashion can also be modeled with a set of 
quadratic constraints. The constraints for adaptive selection can be split
into two subsets. The first subset encodes the order of selection of the 
kernels, while the second subset encodes the selection of the number of the
kernels. The two subsets are equally sized (\code{length(K) - 1}) and are 
sequentially included in the output list.

\examples{
n <- 50
p <- 20
K <- replicate(8, matrix(rnorm(n*p), nrow = n, ncol = p), simplify = FALSE)
K <-  sapply(K, function(X) return(X \%*\% t(X) / dim(X)[2]), simplify = FALSE)
L <- matrix(rnorm(n*p), nrow = n, ncol = p)
L <-  L \%*\% t(L) / p
adaS <- adaFOHSIC(K, L)
listQ <- adaQ(K, select = adaS[["selection"]], n = adaS[["n"]])
