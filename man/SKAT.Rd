\title{implements the sequence kernel association test for GWAS data}
\usage{
SKAT(Y, K, sigma = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{Y}{response vector}

\item{K}{list of kernel similarity matrices. The sum kernel is used in
the quadratic form.}

\item{sigma}{standard deviation of the response Y}
}
\value{
\eqn{p}-value of the SKAT test
}
\description{
The SKAT test is a quadratic test of association between a
phenotype of interest and a genomic region. One of the main
benefits of the SKAT test is the incorporation of nonlinear
effects through the use of a kernel similarity matrix in the
quadratic form. For instance, the identical-by-state (IBS) kernel
which computes the number of identical alleles between two samples
can be used.
}
\details{
The null hypothesis in the SKAT test is the absence of effects
of the SNPs within the region of interest and the outcome. Under the null,
the distribution of the test statistic is a weighted sum of chi-square
distributions whose quantiles are computed using the davies formula.

\examples{
n <- 30
p <- 20
K <- replicate(5, matrix(rnorm(n*p), nrow = n, ncol = p), simplify = FALSE)
K <-  sapply(K, function(X) return(X \%*\% t(X) / dim(X)[2]), simplify = FALSE)
Y <- rnorm(n)
SKAT(Y, K)
